SEMIGROUPS AND MONOIDS
====================================================

In this sample example I have shared a very basic example about the properties of Semigroups and Monoids. 

MONOIDS
=======

Basically Monoid contains two properties as follows

```
Associativity
```

```
Identity Element
```

SEMIGROUPS
==========

Semigroup contains only one property as follows

```
Associativity
```
